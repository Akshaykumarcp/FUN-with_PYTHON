You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. 
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height X wall width) รท coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 X 4) รท 5
                     = 1.6
                     = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by itself and 1.

You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.
