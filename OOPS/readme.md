## Object Oriented Programming
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows abstraction through the concept of interacting entities. 
- This programming works contradictory to conventional model and is procedural, in which programs are organized as a sequence of commands or statements to perform.
- We can think an object as an entity that resides in memory, has a state and it's able to perform some actions.
- More formally objects are entities that represent instances of a general abstract concept called class. In Python, "attributes" are the variables defining an object state and the possible actions are called "methods".

- In Python, everything is an object also classes and functions.
- Each class represents meaningful view of the objects that are instances of this class, without going into too much detail or giving others access to the inner workings of the objects i.e. how it works internally. 
- The class contains instance variables, also known as data members as well as some methods for some purpose also known as member functions. 
- Object of the class can access this methods to achieve something meaningful.

## Goals of object oriented design

- Robustness
    1) Our program should run properly even with unexpected data
    2) We need to write in such a way that it handles complex programs and it can handle with unexpected data.

    - For example, if a program is expecting a string and instead it will receive negative integer, then the program should be able to recover and handle this type of error gracefully.

- Adaptability
    1) Software program or application will grow over a life time
    2) The application should build such a way that is should run with different versions, different generations, different hardware as well.

    - Software program or application should have the option to advance after some time in light of changing conditions.
    - Along these lines, this is significant objective of value in programming that flexibility ought to be accomplished. 
    - Program should be build in such a way that it will run with minor change on various hardware and os platforms.

- Reusability
    - Building from reusable applications to avoid making entire new application just like rebuilding entire wheel.
